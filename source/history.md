#History
WJRH was established in 1946 on the third floor of Hogg Hall at Lafayette College. "Radio Lafayette" serves both the student body of Lafayette and the City of Easton by championing free speech and providing a unique free-form listening experience. WJRH has hosted many artists, from TBÃ¸rns and Ben Folds to more up-and-coming acts like The Rooks. In addition to artists, WJRH boasts a diverse and talented group of both student and community DJs who help to contribute to the Lafayette College soundtrack. Since 2010, WJRH have been streaming online at WJRH.org; we are honored and excited to continue WJRH's proud past as a vital part of the Lafayette experience.
