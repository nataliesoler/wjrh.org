		<p>Formed in 2011, the Brooklyn-based group <a href="http://www.denitiaandsene.com/">denitia and sene.</a> has released one full-length album, a handful of singles, and two EPs—all of which show off the band’s ability to move seamlessly between pure pop, subdued electronica, and slinky R&amp;B with a sound that brings to mind everything from Massive Attack, The Fugees, or the shadowy late-night atmospherics of The XX. <%= link_to 'more events', '/events' %>.</p>
