		<p>We're a 100% student run volunteer based organization and we're one of the biggest organizations on the Lafayette College and we're a team of passionate people interested in Music, Broadcasting and Events.</p>
		<p> We have a board that handles coordination and allocation of resources. We're organized lightly and in a flat structure. The board meets every Wednesday that is also a school day at 5 in the station. If you are an active DJ or a member of the community committed to Broadcasting, <a href="/joining-the-board">consider joining us</a>. We're always looking for people interested in taking responsibility in supporting our community and promoting our station.</p>
