#Joining the Board

General expectations for a WJRH Board Member are:

- 1 hour meeting time each week
- Willing to learn
- Willing to work in groups

These requirements are very relaxed, because each board member works independently or in a team on their own time to complete tasks and goals set out together as a board.

General Manager, Assistant General Manager, Treasurer and the Chief Engineer is selected from the incumbent board with an internal election. For other positions, we solicit applications from the wider community and elect leaders from a wider pool. Board Member applicants do not need to be current Disk Jockeys, as long as they are interested in working in the board. The board determines the number of positions open on the board each calendar year. Below you can find the traditional open positions. Please join the WJRH General Body mailing list to receive more information each December.
